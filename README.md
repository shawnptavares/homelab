# 🧪 Homelab Project — In Progress & Under Construction

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a living document of my journey building out a personal homelab to support learning, experimentation, and eventual transition into remote IT/cloud consulting work.

---

## 📌 What Is This Homelab For?

This homelab will serve as:
- A **sandbox for infrastructure** technologies (networking, virtualization, monitoring)
- A **testbed for Docker containers and services** like Dashy, Pi-hole, Uptime Kuma, and more
- A way to **practice and document enterprise-grade setups** in a smaller, reproducible environment
- A portfolio piece showing applied skill in networking, scripting, system management, and documentation

## 🧱 Project Structure

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`raspberry-pi/`](./raspberry-pi) | Setting up and configuring a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as the first homelab node |
| [`networking/`](./networking) | Network architecture and VLAN separation using a NETGEAR GS308E switch |
| [`firewall-router/`](./firewall-router) *(planned)* | Provisioning a mini PC with pfSense as the core homelab router |
| *(More to come)* | NAS, monitoring stack, virtual lab hosts, etc. |

## 🛠️ Current Status

This lab is in early setup stages:
- ✅ Raspberry Pi chosen and ready for provisioning
- ✅ VLAN and IP planning complete
- ✅ Switch ordered and network design sketched
- ⏳ Router/firewall setup pending
- ⏳ Docker service installation pending

Check out the individual folders for more detailed documentation and plans.

## 🧭 Why This Project?

My end goal is to live and work remotely — and to **build a skillset I can stand behind**. By designing and documenting this lab, I'm building toward:
- Hands-on infrastructure & cloud skills
- A solid GitHub portfolio
- Confidence working with real-world networking + Linux + Windows + containerized environments

## 🚧 Still Under Construction

This is a live build — things will change, break, and improve. Contributions, feedback, or tips always welcome! More updates to come as components are added.
